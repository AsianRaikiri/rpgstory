# About
This is a project for my university. The project consists of a simple story rpg mode with battles enabled in the CLI. 

# How to develop this game
After cloning this repository, there are only a few commands that needed to be used to start developing locally. 

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g
rpgstory
```
"npm run build" will build the js files in the dist folder that will be created for that occasion. 

"npm install -g" will allow you to access the game starting command from any folder.

"rpgstory" is the command to start the game
